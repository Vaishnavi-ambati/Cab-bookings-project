# Cab-bookings-project
Predicting number of bookings in an hour bases on other factors.

1. Visualized data to draw insights which can be used to build model or to improve model.
2. Understood what algorithm to be used.
3. Used StandardScaler to Standardize the data and used LinearRegression to build the model.
4. In the final code the following tasks are performed:
  * Outlier Analysis
  * Feature Selection - Gradient Boost Regressor, Random Forest Regressor, XGBoost Regressor
  * Ensemble Learning
  * Overfitting resolution
  * Hyperparameter Tuning using GridSearchCV
